# Introduction

As an aspiring data analyst, I was curious about the current state of the data job market. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I already worked on a SQL project through Luke Barousse's Data Analytics course, which provided me with great insights about data roles. I decided to further my learnings with his Python course, which gave me the opportunity to unlock more insights with the help of visualizations. üìä I analyzed data roles in the Philippines, focusing on salary levels, in-demand skills, and Data Analyst positions. Leveraging data from 2023 job postings, I used Python to visualize important insights on the data industry. Let's dive in! ü§ì

# The Questions

These are the questions I wanted to find the answers to through this project:
1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles (in the Philippines)?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

# Tools I Used

For this project, I used these key tools:

- **Python:** This allowed me to analyze the given data and uncover valuable insights. I also used these libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** For analyzing data
    - **Matplotlib Library:** For visualizing data
    - **Seaborn Library:** For more advanced visualizations
- **Visual Studio Code:** This made executing Python scripts more convenient and efficient.
- **Git & Github:** These allowed me to share my Python scripts and analysis, and made sure versions were kept up to date.

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

First I created a new dataframe focusing on job postings in the Philippines. Then I grouped this by skill count to get the most in demand skills. I also filtered this out to get the top 5 skills for the top 3 most popular job titles. This highlights the skills demanded by the most popular job titles, so I know which skills to focus on depending on the role I want.

### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 70)

    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in PH Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
plt.show()
```

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

Now that I knew the in-demand skills for the top 3 roles in the PH, I wanted to see which skills had a steady demand throughout the year. I grouped the skill count by month posted, and calculated for the percentages that each skill was mentioned in the total number of job postings that month. Visualizing this data through a line graph made it easier for me to see if these skills were consistently in demand.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

### Salary Analysis for Data Roles

I wanted to analyze the salaries of the top 6 data roles in the Philippines. To do this, I dropped the rows with null values in average yearly salary and then got the top 6 roles. I then visualized the data using a boxplot so it could show me the salary range of each role and compare salaries across roles.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](3_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_PH_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

plt.title('Salary Distribution in the Philippines')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary ($USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 180000)
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.show()
```

### Results

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Then, I zeroed in on Data Analyst roles. I wanted to know what the highest paid skills associated with Data Analyst roles were, and how this compared with the most in-demand skills. I visualized this using bar charts depicting the top 10 highest paid skills vs. the top 10 most in-demand skills.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='dark:b_r')
ax[0].legend().remove()

ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the PH')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()

ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the PH')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary ($USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results

## 4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts?

I discovered what the highest paid and most in-demand skills for data analysts were, but which skills are most important to focus on? Which ones are highly sought after as well as highly paid? How do these compare to the other skills? To gather insights, I calculated for the likelihood each skill would be mentioned in a Data Analyst job posting. I compared this to the median salary associated with each skill, and visualized this on a scatterplot.

# What I Learned

Throughout this project, I've added some valuable skills to my Python toolkit:
- üì¶ Installing Packages: Using packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn is essential when it comes to making your code simpler and more efficient. With these tools, I was able to execute commands in a matter of seconds with just a few lines of code. This made my code neater and easier to read, and saved so much time.
- üìâ Visualizing Data: Sometimes data can be overwhelming or too difficult to understand on its own. With the help of visualizations, data can reveal so many important insights. I've learned to create a variety of visualizations from bar graphs to scatter plots, to help me understand the complex narratives data can tell.
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Troubleshooting Errors: Even the smallest typo in code can cause the most confusing errors. I've run into a few errors that had me scratching my head and staring at my screen for hours. With the help of ChatGPT and online forums, I was able to understand the roots of some errors and learn how to avoid or tackle them. It's inevitable to make mistakes in code; we just need the patience to solve them.

Working on this project solidified my understanding that skills like SQL, Python, and Excel were essential for a data analyst. It's amazing that while practicing Python with the aim of becoming a data analyst, I was actually able to learn so much more about the data job market! üí° I realized that Python is such a powerful tool for data, especially with all the packages available for people to use to make their workflow smoother and more efficient. I was able to create data visualizations that provided snapshots of real-life situations in the job market. Overall, this whole project made me more confident in my ability to write Python code, and unlocked many valuable insights that I'll use in my job search. ü§ì
